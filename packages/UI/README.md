  Devlaunchers Design System
</h1>

Components, styles, and utilities are the core of the Devlaunchers brand shared across its websites. They're most notably used on [devlaunchers.org](https://devlaunchers.org) but are also found on our internal websites and tools.

This storybook represents components found in the Devlaunchers monorepo, specifically the [@devlaunchers/components](https://github.com/dev-launchers/dev-launchers-platform/tree/master/packages/UI) package and derived from the amazing work of the universal design team's [figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/EwzuhhvTulvFRMvhTD5VAh/DL-Universal-Design-System).

Its organization roughly aligns with variations of [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/).

## ðŸš€ Quick start

    ```

1.  **Start using components!**

    Open http://localhost:6006 in your browser (should happen automatically) and start reading the documentation from within storybook.
