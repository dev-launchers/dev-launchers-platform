# Getting started with the Platform Enablement Team

dev-launchers-platform is a mono repo using yarn. All yarn script lines need to be run in the root folder. 

## Installing and quick started
1. install yarn 
    - https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable
    - In a terminal with admin run "$ corepack enable"
    - "$ npm install --global yarn"
2. clone the repo @  https://github.com/dev-launchers/dev-launchers-platform
3. After cloning repo, navigate to /dev-launchers-platform
4. ```$ yarn install``` in the root folder to install dependencies 
5. Open a new terminal and run ```$ yarn workspace @devlaunchers/tailwind dev```. to start tailwind constructor.
5. Open a 2nd terminal and run ```$ yarn workspace @devlaunchers/components storybook``` to start storybook.
7. Start Development work.

## Yarn scripts basics.

This is just a quick rundown on how to run scripts in a mono repo using yarn, you will need to target a workspace with the following CLI.  Further information can be found in the root folder markdowns. 

    $ yarn workspace @devlaunchers/<workspace> <cmd>

### Yarn scripts for this team
```
$ yarn workspace @devlaunchers/tailwind dev
$ yarn workspace @devlaunchers/components storybook
$ yarn workspace @devlaunchers/components typecheck
```

### Installing packages

To install a package into a specific workspace:

    $ yarn workspace @devlaunchers/<workspace> add <library>

#### Installing Radix-ui components

Radix-ui components need to be installed individually, if you are not able to import @radix-ui follow the command below to install in devlaunchers components workspace.

    $ yarn workspace @devlaunchers/components add <library>

Below is the command to install radix-ui/react-checkbox

    $ yarn workspace @devlaunchers/components add @radix-ui/react-checkbox


## Git branch checkout flow

We will be working out of development/components. 

    $ git checkout development/components

- after switching to the development/components branch, make sure you "yarn install" for new dependencies

### Out of "development/components" branch all new branches will be created off of it.

    $ git checkout -b components/newBranchName


## Figma

Go to universal Figma @:

    https://www.figma.com/file/EwzuhhvTulvFRMvhTD5VAh/DL-Universal-Design-System?type=design&t=w1PSPgQunxcd19Bz-6

- All component designs will be coming from the universal UI library.
- Make sure dev mode is toggled in Figma.
- All tailwind classes will be made up of dashes, other characters like '/' will be replaced with '-'.

## Vscode extensions

1. Tailwind css intellisense
2. Eslint
3. ES7 + React/redux/React-native snippets.
4. Figma for vs code

### Storybook snippet

```
	"create a sample storybook story.tsx file to connect": {
		"prefix": "story",
		"body": [
		  "import type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react';",
		  "",
		  "import $1 from './$1';",
		  "",
		  "const meta: Meta<typeof $1> = {",
		  "  component: $1,",
		  "};",
		  "",
		  "export default meta;",
		  "type Story = StoryObj<typeof $1>;",
		  "",
		  "/*",
		  " *ðŸ‘‡ Render functions are a framework specific feature to allow you control on how the component renders.",
		  " * See https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/api/csf",
		  " * to learn how to use render functions.",
		  " */",
		  "export const Primary: Story = {",
		  "  render: () => <$1 />,",
		  "};",
		  ""
		],
		"description": "create a sample story"
  }

```

## Storybook & tailwind dev environment. 

In a terminal, in order to get tailwind classes in your project you will need to run the dev command.

    $ yarn workspace @devlaunchers/tailwind dev

Storybook will be the primary way you will see your design changes. Running "components storybook" this is open up a browser for storybook. This is where you can see changes that are made. By running the command below, a window should open with storybook running.

    $ yarn workspace @devlaunchers/components storybook



## Creating new components in project.

When creating the folder/files in src/components :

- The Project Components folder should match the Figma design location 
    - Example "src/components/Checkbox"
- Project Components names should match the design Name - "Capitalized"
    - Example "src/components/Checkbox/Checkbox.tsx"
- Project components need a #.stories.tsx to work with storybook.
  - find a template or copy from another stories.tsx
- Create an index.ts file for exporting the tsx files. 
    ```
    export { default as Alert } from './Alert';
    export type {AlertProp} from './Alert'
    ```


## Adding assets

For .tsx assets check the need too re-export all components into an index.ts for exporting in the folder that it is living in.
 
```
packages/UI/src/assets/icons/index.ts
```


## Jsdocs auto intergration with storybook.

Attempt to put all documentation via jsdocs. Storyblok will auto import depending on the location of the jsdocs. Make it so documenation is only in one location in code, and both storybook and jsdocs draw from the same location. 


## Submit the branch with a new pull request.

In git bash, you will want to do the git push flow.
