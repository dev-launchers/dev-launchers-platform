## Git branch checkout flow

We will be working out of development/components. 

    $ git checkout development/components

- after switching to the development/components branch, make sure you "yarn install" for new dependencies

### Out of "development/components" branch all new branches will be created off of it.

    $ git checkout -b components/newBranchName


## Figma

Go to universal Figma @:

    https://www.figma.com/file/EwzuhhvTulvFRMvhTD5VAh/DL-Universal-Design-System?type=design&t=w1PSPgQunxcd19Bz-6

- All component designs will be coming from the universal UI library.
- Make sure dev mode is toggled in Figma.
- All tailwind classes will be made up of dashes, other characters like '/' will be replaced with '-'.

## Vscode extensions

```extensions.json``` in this workspace will recommend the follow extensions when you first open the workspace:

1. Tailwind css intellisense
2. Eslint
3. ES7 + React/redux/React-native snippets.
4. Figma for vs code



### Storybook snippet

By typing "story" in an empty file, you can get the below snippet as a starter for storybook files. When thes snippet is imported it will have selected all the parts needs to type in your Component.

```
import type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react';

import Component from './Component';

const meta: Meta<typeof Component> = {
  component: Component,
};

export default meta;
type Story = StoryObj<typeof Component>;

/*
 *ðŸ‘‡ Render functions are a framework specific feature to allow you control on how the component renders.
 * See https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/api/csf
 * to learn how to use render functions.
 */
export const Primary: Story = {
  render: () => <Component />,
};
```

## Storybook & tailwind dev environment. 

In a terminal, in order to get tailwind classes in your project you will need to run the dev command.

    $ yarn workspace @devlaunchers/tailwind dev

Storybook will be the primary way you will see your design changes. Running "components storybook" this is open up a browser for storybook. This is where you can see changes that are made. By running the command below, a window should open with storybook running.

    $ yarn workspace @devlaunchers/components storybook



## Creating new components in project.

When creating the folder/files in src/components :

- The Project Components folder should match the Figma design location 
    - Example "src/components/Checkbox"
- Project Components names should match the design Name - "Capitalized"
    - Example "src/components/Checkbox/Checkbox.tsx"
- Project components need a #.stories.tsx to work with storybook.
  - find a template or copy from another stories.tsx
- Create an index.ts file for exporting the tsx files. 
    ```
    export { default as Alert } from './Alert';
    export type {AlertProp} from './Alert'
    ```


## Adding assets

For .tsx assets check the need too re-export all components into an index.ts for exporting in the folder that it is living in.
 
```
packages/UI/src/assets/icons/index.ts
```


## Jsdocs auto intergration with storybook.

Attempt to put all documentation via jsdocs. Storybook will auto import depending on the location of the jsdocs. Make it so documenation is only in one location in code, and both storybook and jsdocs draw from the same location. 

As a example - Tabs story in storybook will grab this jsdocs, at the same time it will be shown by a description in mouse hover.
