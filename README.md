## About Dev Launchers

Dev Launchers is a nonprofit tech company working to democratize access to technology and tech related skills. At our core, we build projects and run programs that are designed to prepare the world for a rapidly changing future. We've built an inclusive, software focused incubator giving people from diverse backgrounds the skills and resources necessary to succeed in careers touched by technology, and have an open community focused on advancing technology, one another, and ourselves. This repository holds the beginnings of the online platform we're creating in order to first impart the general skills required for members to begin their own projects, and then support their exploration as they tackle building something they're excited about. It also functions as our organization's website!
