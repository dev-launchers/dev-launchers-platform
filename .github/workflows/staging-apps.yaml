#I think this needs a bit of explanation.
#I'm extracting the branch name and modifying it to only show what comes after staging/
#for example: if this action was triggered on staging/ideaspace the modified string becomes 'ideaspace'.

#I'm doing this because in cloudflare pages dashboard I created these projects

#- 'ideaspace'
#- 'ideaspace1'
#- 'ideaspace2'
#- 'recruitment'
#- 'recruitment1'
#- 'recruitment2'
#- 'projects'
#- 'projects1'
#- 'projects2'
#- 'website'
#- 'website1'
#- 'website2'
#and on every commit that touches the branches of these teams I deploy to the app from the branch name extraction step:  Extract branch name
