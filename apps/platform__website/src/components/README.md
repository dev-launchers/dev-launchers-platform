Our components should be relatively aligned with the Smart vs Dumb aka Container component pattern seen here: https://medium.com/@thejasonfile/dumb-components-and-smart-components-e7b33a698d43

The 'modules' directory contains specialty components grouped by feature or domain.

The 'common' directory contains components shared across routes, used in multiple areas of the app.

We're using folder structures and conventions very similar to those described here: https://hackernoon.com/structuring-projects-and-naming-components-in-react-1261b6e18d76
