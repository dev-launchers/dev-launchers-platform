Dev Launchers is a nonprofit organization that trains software developers by facilitating their learning and growth. At the same time, they build software, apps, and tools that benefit humanity and promote social good in various ways. A large focus of the organization is helping to achieve the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals, such as poverty, hunger, health, equality, education, water, energy, economic growth, innovation, sustainability, justice, and the environment. Three examples of projects they might tackle are:
 * An online platform to help new developers learn skills while contributing to projects. The platform nurtures the stages of projects all the way from idea to development to release. It also acts as a professional-based social media hub for developers and helps the projects hosted on the platform recruit ambitious devs.
 * An app that uses computer vision to identify logos on products using a smartphone camera, then displays every matched company's carbon footprint and other environment-related metrics to the user to promote educated consumerism. This is mainly geared toward finding and avoiding products that are heavily involved in deforestation due to palm oil.
 * `,
